* Installing Emacs from source

** Ubuntu 12.04

$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git

$ sudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev libxpm-dev
libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev libncurses5-dev libtinfo-dev libglib2.0-dev
intl-fonts libgtk2.0-dev libxaw3dxft6 librsvg2-dev imagemagick libdbus-1-dev
libgconf2-dev libm17n-dev libotf-dev graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat

# This second step can probably be avoided/replaced with
# $ sudo build-dep emacs
# Need to try that out one of these days

$ make distclean
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/emacs/ --with-xft --with-x-toolkit
$ make bootstrap
$ sudo make install

** Mac OS X 10.7

$ brew install emacs --HEAD --cocoa --use-git-head

$ brew linkapps

# After installing from brew, head to /Library/Caches/Homebrew/emacs--git/
# (source is downloaded here) and make tags for the source

$ make tags

* Emacs Refcards
  - M-x locate <RET> refcard <RET>
  - profit.
* Clj -> Elisp Cheat Sheet
** map = mapcar
mapc is similar to mapcar, expect that it does not accumulate the results.
mapc should be used for side-effects, where we don't care about the
return value.
** apply = apply
The way to call this is:
(apply #'equal '(:a :A))
** keep = delq nil
** = = equal
** first = car
** rest = cdr
** Other Notes:
The function `funcall` can be used to treat the first argument as a
function on the rest of the arguments.

Eg: (funcall #'equal :a :A) => nil
    (funcall #'equal :a :a) => t

* Regex replacements
  Taken right from the Emacs Manual (I always seem to forget this).
  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexp-Replace.html

  M-x replace-regexp <RET> c[ad]+r <RET> \&-safe <RET>
  replaces (for example) ‘cadr’ with ‘cadr-safe’ and ‘cddr’ with ‘cddr-safe’.

  M-x replace-regexp <RET> \(c[ad]+r\)-safe <RET> \1 <RET>
  ‘\d’ in newstring, where d is a digit, stands for whatever matched the dth
  parenthesized grouping in regexp.
  Note : The parens making groups need to be escaped.

* Compiling and Running Emacs 28 on the native-comp feature branch (Ubuntu).
** The gist of it, building Emacs from Source
  #+begin_src shell-script
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-nativecomp
    # If everything works
    make
    # Test the binary
    src/emacs -Q
    # Install the binary
    sudo make install
  #+end_src
** Problems during Installation
*** Configure fails because libgccjit fails the smoketest
- Ensure that libgccjit is installed and at the latest version (at
  this point in time, the latest version is 10)
- Ensure that gcc is at the same version as libgccjit (also 10)
- Install the Ubuntu toolchain PPA for the latest versions of gcc and libgccjit.
  + https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
- After updating / installing the latest gcc, libgccjit-* packages,
  you will need to use update-alternatives to ensure that the correct
  tools are being picked.
  #+begin_src shell-script :eval no
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-10 10
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-10 10
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-9 9
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-9 9
    sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
    sudo update-alternatives --config g++
  #+end_src
- Ensure that gcc-10 is selected, so that you don't see the 'failed
  smoke test' error message from libgccjit.
*** Configure fails because various libraries don't exist on your system.
- Emacs needs a number of different libraries during compilation. You
  should look for an install the =-dev= version of any such libraries
  that are missing. (Eg: =libxpm-dev=, =libgif-dev=, =libtiff-dev=)
** Problems Post Installation
*** You need to generate native compiled files for all your emacs-lisp code
- Add this to your init.el
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (if (and (fboundp 'native-comp-available-p)
             (native-comp-available-p))
        (setq comp-deferred-compilation t)
      (message "Native complation is *not* available"))
  #+end_src
- The message in the above code will also tell you whether the Native
  Compilation binary is correctly built.
- As a one-time run, you can also execute the following code after  =M-x ielm=
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (native-compile-async "/home/<yourname>/.emacs.d" t)
    #+end_src
- This will create all the necessary =.eln= files for you.
*** You need to clean install your packages, preferably the latest versions of the packages
- Best to just reinstall all the packages you depend on, to ensure
  that they get compiled properly.
*** Start and profit, huge speed boosts.
- Very little configuration code broke for me (only one =isearch=
  modification broke, which used =substitute-key-definition= and
  substituted a function which took optional arguments with another
  function which took 0 arguments. This seems to not work within
  native compilation.

** Set up the prerequisite libraries
This command is created by:
1. Run the command ~sudo apt build-dep emacs~ and copy all the
   packages it will install. (*Don't actually install the packages*)
2. Remove all the ImageMagick related libraries from this command, we
   have installed it from source.
3. Review the output of ~./configure~ command in Emacs. See if there
   are new options which are not covered by your distribution's old
   version of Emacs.
