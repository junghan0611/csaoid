:END:
If you have a local script or ~.bashrc~ or some other config script, avoid exporting/setting secret variables directly in these scripts. Instead:

1. Open *Keychain Access.app*
2. Add a new keychain from *File > New keychain*
   - Using new keychain will allow you to use a different password than login for storing secrets.
   - You can also use the login keychain, if you don't want to enter password each time
3. Add a name for the keychain, once you will click on Save button, it will ask to enter the password for the new keychain.
   - Add a decently complex password.
4. Once added, select the newly created keychain from the left pane of the Keychain Access app.
5. To add a new password item, select *File > New Password Item*. Fill in the following details:
   - Keychain item name: This is the keyword to access your keychain item.
   - Account Name: This could be anything, usually used to group 1 or more password items
   - Password: This is the secret you want to store in the Keychain against this item.
6. Once added, you should test the secret access in terminal with following command:
   #+begin_src sh :eval no
     security find-generic-password -a TEST_account_name -s TEST_item_name -w
   #+end_src

To load secrets, you can now create a function in your script as follows:
#+begin_src sh :eval no
  function load_secrets () {
    export SECRET1=$(security find-generic-password -a TEST_account1 -s TEST_item1 -w)
    export SECRET2=$(security find-generic-password -a TEST_account1 -s TEST_item2 -w)
  }
